Notes
Here are some notes I have taken during my study:

EC2: Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch instances, which are virtual servers running in the cloud.
S3: Simple Storage Service is a web service that provides scalable storage in the cloud. You can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web.
IAM: Identity and Access Management is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You can create and manage users, groups, and roles, and set permissions for them.
Code Examples
Here are some code examples I have written while studying AWS:

python
Copy code
import boto3

# Create an S3 client
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List all S3 buckets
response = s3.list_buckets()

# Print the bucket names
for bucket in response['Buckets']:
    print(bucket['Name'])

Notes
Here are some notes I have taken while learning about DevOps tools:

Docker: Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient, making them ideal for running applications in a DevOps environment.
Jenkins: Jenkins is an open source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development process. It can be used for building, testing, and deploying applications.
Ansible: Ansible is an open source automation tool that helps automate IT tasks, such as configuration management, application deployment, and task automation.
Code Examples
Here are some code examples I have written while learning about DevOps tools:

yaml
Copy code
# Ansible playbook to install and start Apache
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start Apache
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
Conclusion
I hope this repository serves as a helpful resource for anyone else studying AWS or learning about DevOps tools. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out!
